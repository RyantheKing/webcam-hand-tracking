# webcam-hand-tracking
A python program that uses OpenCV to track the position of your hands using an ordinary webcam.
This is the code I created as my contribution to the Webcam Theremin project. (https://github.com/RyantheKing/webcam-theremin)
I have isolated it here so it can be used for other purposes.

## Installation
#### Standalone
Download the file and run `py hand-tracking.py`

#### As a python module
